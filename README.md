# CellEvolutionaryTree
**Function:** Cell growth can be monitored by single-cell time-lapse experiments. However, after the cells are divided, how to connect the cell label numbers is a problem. This code will help you to select a suitable monitoring mother-cell and link the cell evolutionary tree using the reverse overlap method. For example, the cell 7 has a evolutionary tree: 3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7,7.\
